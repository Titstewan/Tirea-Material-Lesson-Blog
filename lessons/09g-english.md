## -ri: What is it?

\-**ri** introduces the topic of what you are about to say. It gives your sentence a theme, and this is often done in English by using "_As for..._" or simply "_for_".

The -**ri** in "**ngeyä srungìri ngaru irayo si oe**" lets us know that the theme is the "**srung**" - _the help_. It tells us that the reason that **oe** is thanking to **nga** is the **srung**... in other words, **oe** thanks **nga** for their _srung_. "_I thank you for your help._"  
The topic (word with -**ri**) almost always comes first in the sentence.

## Typical Use Cases

\-**ri** is found most commonly in sentences with:

-   **irayo si** (for the "_thank for_" meaning)
-   **tsap'alute si** (for the "_apologise for_" meaning)
-   **pey** (for the "_wait for_" meaning)
-   **kllfro'** (for the "_be responsible for_" meaning)
-   **tìkangkem si** (for the "_work on_" meaning)

| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Syurari yerik irayo si awnga por.** | _We thank the hexapede for his energy._ |
| **Fìskxawngìri tsap'alute sängi oe.** | _I apologise for this moron._           |
| **Trrayìri ke tsun oe pivey!**        | _I can't wait for tomorrow!_            |
| **Pori kllfro' nga.**                 | _You are responsible for him._          |
| **Tskori po tìkangkem si**            | _She works on the bow._                 |

<div id="a4"></div>

## Note on -ri vs. fpi+

Lastly, don't confuse -**ri** with **fpi**+. **Fpi**+ means "_for_" as in "_for the sake/benefit of_". With **fpi**, you are acting to benefit something. E.g., **Oe 'ìyem ngafpi**. "_I will cook for (the sake of) you._"
