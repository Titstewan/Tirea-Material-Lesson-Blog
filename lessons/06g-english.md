## This and That

So, to get started... This and that. How many times have you wanted to say something in Na'vi like _This tree is huge_ and _That plant is poisonous_, etc? Well, it's super easy to do this. We have **fì**- and **tsa**- which go onto the beginning of nouns.

| Na'vi     | English   |
| --------- | --------- |
| **fì**-   | _this_    |
| **tsa**-  | _that_    |

For example:

> **Fìutral tsawl lu nìtxan nang!**<br>
> _This tree is huge!_<br>
> <br>
> **Lu tsa'ewll txumnga'.**<br>
> _That plant is poisonous._

<div id="a2"></div>

## These and Those

Mìftxele, It's very similar and just as easy to say these and those. It's just fì- and tsa- combined with me+, pxe+, or ay+ (remember those? ) So you get:

> **Tìkenong fìtseng.**<br>
> _Example here._<br>

<div id="a3"></div>
