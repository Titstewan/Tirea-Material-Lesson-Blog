# This and That, and Stuff

**Kaltxì nìmun**! And welcome to Lesson 6.

This time, let's talk about "_this_" and "_that_" a little bit, and about using words marked as adp. in the dictionary. Words such as _in_, _under_, _behind_, _across_, etc.

## This and That

So, to get started... This and that. How many times have you wanted to say something in Na'vi like _This tree is tall_ and _That plant is poisonous_, etc? Well, it's super easy to do this. We have **fì**- and **tsa**- which go onto the beginning of nouns.

| Na'vi    | English          |
| -------- | ---------------- |
| **fì**-  | _this \_\_\_\_ _ |
| **tsa**- | _that \_\_\_\_ _ |

For example:

> **fìutral tsawl lu.**<br>
> fì-utral tsawl lu<br>
> _This tree is tall._<br>
> <br>
> **Lu tsa'ewll txumnga'.**<br>
> Lu tsa-'ewll txumnga'.<br>
> _That plant is poisonous._

The Na'vi word **'u** means _thing_. Adding one of the above to the beginning of the word makes the pronouns _this_ and _that_:

| Na'vi     | English            |
| --------- | ------------------ |
| **fì'u**  | _this thing; this_ |
| **tsa'u** | _that thing; that_ |

These two words, unlike the prefixes in the previous table, can stand alone and be used like any other noun.

For example:

> **fì'u lu tsko.**<br>
> _this is a bow._<br>
> <br>
> **tsa'u lu niktsyey.**<br>
> _that is a food wrap._

## These and Those

**Mìftxele**, It's very similar and just as easy to say these and those. It's just **fì**- and **tsa**- combined with **me**+, **pxe**+, or **ay**+ (remember those? ) So you get these things that you can add to the beginning of any noun:

| Na'vi       | English             |
| ----------- | ------------------- |
| **fìme**+   | _these \_\_\_\_[2]_ |
| **fìpxe**+  | _these \_\_\_\_[3]_ |
| **fay**+    | _these \_\_\_\_ _   |
| **tsame**+  | _those \_\_\_\_[2]_ |
| **tsapxe**+ | _those \_\_\_\_[3]_ |
| **tsay**+   | _those \_\_\_\_ _   |

Some examples:

> **fìmesute lu tstunwi.**<br>
> fì-me+sute lu tstunwi.<br>
> _these people[2] are kind._<br>
> <br>
> **fayewll lehrrap lu.**<br>
> fay-ewll lehrrap lu.<br>
> _these plants are dangerous._<br>
> <br>
> **lu tsapxeyaney 'om.**<br>
> lu tsa-pxe-yaney 'om.<br>
> _those canoes[3] are purple._

Again these are just prefixes and can't stand alone as the pronouns _these_ or _those_. For the pronouns, we have these:

Starting with the word **'u** (_thing_):

| Na'vi       | English                     |
| ----------- | --------------------------- |
| **fìmeu**   | _these things[2]; these[2]_ |
| **fìpxeu**  | _these things[3]; these[3]_ |
| **fayu**    | _these things; these_       |
| **tsameu**  | _those things[2]; those[2]_ |
| **tsapxeu** | _those things[3]; those[3]_ |
| **tsayu**   | _those things; those_       |

Starting with the word **fì'u** (_this thing; this_) or **tsa'u** (_that thing; that_):

| Na'vi             | English                     |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- |
| **mefì'u**        | _these things[2]; these[2]_ |
| **pxefì'u**       | _these things[3]; these[3]_ |
| **ayfì'u**        | _these things; these_       |
| **mesa'u**        | _those things[2]; those[2]_ |
| **pxesa'u**       | _those things[3]; those[3]_ |
| **aysa'u = sa'u** | _those things; those_       |

## More adp. Words

Now. Remember in [Lesson 3](/index.php?p=lessons&l=03g-english) I said that **me**+, **pxe**+, and **ay**+ weren't the only things that cause a word to change its first letter? Well, I'm about to list every single other word that does this. This would be a good list to remember, or reference at least.

| Na'vi       | English                   |
| ----------- | ------------------------- |
| **fpi**+    | _for the sake/benifit of_ |
| **ìlä**+    | _according to, by, via_   |
| **lisre**+  | _by, before_              |
| **mì**+     | _in, on_                  |
| **nuä**+    | _beyond_                  |
| **pxisre**+ | _right before_            |
| **ro**+     | _at_                      |
| **sko**+    | _as, in the role of_      |
| **sre**+    | _before_                  |
| **wä**+     | _against_                 |

These words here are all adp. in the dictionary. They are used like this...

> **oel wutsoti hawl fpi soaia.**<br>
> _I prepare dinner for the family._<br>
> <br>
> **Ìlä Feyral, muntxa soli Ralu sì Newey.**<br>
> _According to Peyral, Ralu and Newey were married._<br>

Note here that proper nouns, i.e. official names of people or places, are in fact also subject to the sound/letter change just like any other noun. Also, here we see **ìlä**+ (_according to_) used as a _separate word before_ the name **Peyral**, (and causing it to become **Feyral**).

> **tsampxisre hawl aysamsiyu.**<br>
> _The warriors prepare right before the war._<br>

Here we see **pxisre**+ (_right before_) attached to the end of the noun **tsam** (_war_).

### Some notes

As you see, In these examples, the adp. words are all either separate before, or attached after the noun they go with. All adp. words work like that. The adp. words in the table from before have that + sign again, meaning that they make the first letter change thing happen so watch out!
