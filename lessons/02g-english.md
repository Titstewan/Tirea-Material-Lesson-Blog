**Kaltxì**! And welcome to Lesson 2 of the Simplified Grammar Lessons series.

Ok so now we discuss how to talk about the past and the future.

## The Past

In English, verbs are usually changed somehow to show that whatever it is happened in the past. For example:

Present | Past
------- | ----
eat     | ate
find    | found
run     | ran
hunt    | hunted
walk    | walked

The pain about this in English is, these are very unpredictable and have to just be memorized.

In Na'vi, verbs are also changed, but it is very predictable. You just put an _infix_ inside in order to change it to a specific meaning. For talking about the past, the following are inserted into the Na'vi verb:

Infix    | Meaning
-------- | ----------------------------------
<**am**> | _happened in the past_
<**ìm**> | _just happened in the recent past_

Here is a sentence in the present tense:

- **oel taron yerikit.**
- _I hunt hexapede._

Here it is in the past tense:

- **oel yerikit tamaron.**
- _I hunted hexapede._

And here it is in the "recent past" tense:
- **tìmaron oel yerikit.**
- _I just hunted hexapede._

As you can see, I took advantage of the flexible word order of Na'vi in these examples. :)Also, when speaking or reading, don't put emphasis/stress on the infixes (such as <**am**> or <**ìm**>). Rule of thumb: _The original verb nearly always keeps its stress_.

## The Future

In English, to talk about the future, we use a helper verb _will_. For example, _You will eat teylu_. and _She will help me_.

In Na'vi, we don't use a helper verb like will. Instead, like talking about the past, something is put inside the verb that means it will happen in the future. For talking about the future, the following are inserted into verbs:

Infix    | Meaning
-------- | ----------------------------------
<**ìy**> | _about to happen in the near future_
<**ay**> | _will happen in the future_

For example:

- **Ngal teyluti yayom.**
- _You will eat teylu._

And

- **Po srung sìyi oeru.**
- _S/he will help me._

**Mìftxele** (_by the way, related to this_), [click here](http://james-camerons-avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Teylu) to learn more about teylu. :)

Even though **srung si** (_help_) is two words, it's best thought of as a single package. It really means _to do assistance_. So what I really said there is _She is about to do assistance to me_.

Also, notice how the <**ìy**> is put inside the **si** part of **srung si**. This is how it's done for all other verbs of this kind. Such as **tìkangkem si** (_to work_), **pamrel si** (_to write_), etc. Which brings me to the next point...

## Infix Locations

So how do I know where in the verb to put these things? Well...it's easiest to use the [LearnNavi dictionary](https://eanaeltu.learnnavi.org/dicts/NaviDictionary.pdf). Here's how it works. To start, here is the entry for taron:

<ul><li>
  <font face="Times New Roman" size="6pt">
    <strong>taron:</strong>
    <span class="blue-text">
      [ˈt<span class="red-text">·</span>a.ɾ<span class="red-text">·</span>on]
    </span>
    <sub>
      <i>JC,PF</i>
    </sub> vtr. <i>hunt</i>
  </font>
</li></ul>

Look at the part in blue. That is the pronunciation guide. In some entries, this part looks all scary and has loads of weird looking symbols. But for this blog post and lesson though, we are only concerned about the two _raised dots_ which I've colored red here.

These _raised dots_ show you where to put things in.

This blog post only contains stuff that would go in the _first_ dot's space. Some verbs only have one dot. If so, that's where it goes.

<ul><li>
  <font face="Times New Roman" size="6pt">
    <strong>kar:</strong>
    <span class="blue-text">
      [ˈk<span class="red-text">·</span>aɾ]
    </span>
    <sub>
      <i>PF</i>
    </sub> vtr. <i>teach</i>
  </font>
</li></ul>
