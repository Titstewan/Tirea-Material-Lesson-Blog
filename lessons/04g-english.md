## Describing With lu

In Na'vi, We describe what something _is_ with **lu**. In this case, it's like an "=" sign. Some examples:

> **Eyktan lu txantslusam.**<br>
> _The leader is wise._
>
> **Tsamsiyu txur lu.**<br>
> _The warrior is strong._

That's pretty much what it looks like to describe something by saying what it _is_ by using **lu**. Notice that none of the words are modified in any way; we can just get any noun (_n._) and any adjective (_adj._) from the dictionary, and then place them in a 3-word sentence with **lu**. All word orders of such a sentence will share the same meaning.

But what if you wanted to describe a noun on the fly while saying something else about it? Check it out:

<div id="a2"></div>

## Describing With a

> **txantslusama eyktan plltxe.**<br>
> =<br>
> **eyktan atxantslusam plltxe.**<br>
> _The wise leader speaks._
>
> **txura tsamsiyu wem.**<br>
> =<br>
> **tsamsiyu atxur wem.**<br>
> _The strong warrior fights._
>
> **nga lu taronyu asìltsan.**<br>
> =<br>
> **nga lu sìltsana taronyu.**<br>
> _You are a good hunter._

You probably notice that when describing the noun on the fly while saying something else about it, there there is an -**a**- attached onto the adjective that describes the noun. You may also notice that the -**a**- is always attached onto the side of the adjective where the noun is, and that the adjective is always exactly next to the noun.

Above, we talked about describing a noun with a single adjective. Now, I'm going to show you how you can do exactly the same thing as above, but instead of describing it with just a single word, describe it with a whole phrase of words. Check it out:

> **lrrtok si pxìm a tuté oeru sunu.**<br>
> _The smiles often -> woman to me is pleasing/likeable._<br>
> =<br>
> **sunu oeru tuté a lrrtok si pxìm.**<br>
> _is pleasing/likeable to me woman &lt;- smiles often._<br>
> _"I like the woman who smiles often."_<br>

Here in this example, instead of using a single adjective such as {**txur**} (_strong_) or {**txantslusam**} (_wise_) to describe the noun **tuté** (_woman_), we are using an entire phrase, namely, {**lrrtok si pxìm**} (_smiles often_).

The rule for **a** is pretty much the same as for the -**a**- we attach to adjectives: The word **a** floats in between the description (in this example, {**lrrtok si pxìm**}) and the noun it describes (in this example, **tuté**).

The main skeleton of this sentence is **tuté oeru sunu** = **sunu oeru tuté** (_I like the woman_).

> **fpe' ayngal oer a 'upxareti stawm oel.**<br>
> _The send you me -> message hear I._<br>
> =<br>
> **oel stawm 'upxaret a ayngal fpe' oer.**<br>
> _I hear the message &lt;- you send me._<br>
> _"I hear the message that you send to me."_

In this case, the phrase {**fpe' ayngal oer**} = {**ayngal fpe' oer**} (_you send to me_) is describing **'upxareti** (_the message_).

The main skeleton of this sentence is **'upxareti stawm oel** = **oel stawm 'upxaret** (_I hear the message_).
