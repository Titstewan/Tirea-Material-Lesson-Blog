## Question Words

Let's dive right in with some quick vocab.

| Na'vi     | English  |
| --------- | -------- |
| **tute**  | _person_ |
| **'u**    | _thing_  |
| **tseng** | _place_  |
| **lun**   | _reason_ |
| **krr**   | _time_   |
| **fya'o** | _way_    |

To form question words like _who_, _what_, _where_, etc., You add -**pe**+ (_what_/_which_) onto the nouns listed above. It can go either onto the beginning or onto the end. **Fya'o** shortens to **fya** in this case. **Pefya** / **Fyape** is by far more common than **fya'ope** or **pefya'o**.  And there's the + sign again. Remember [a few lessons ago](/index.php?p=lessons&l=03g-english), this means that -**pe**+ when used on the beginning of a word, may cause the word's first letter to change.

The question words in Na'vi, again, are just the above nouns with the -**pe**+ added either to the beginning or end:

| Na'vi                    | english |
| ------------------------ | ------- |
| **pesu** = **tupe**      | _who_   |
| **peu** = **'upe**       | _what_  |
| **peseng** = **tsengpe** | _where_ |
| **pelun** = **lumpe**    | _why_   |
| **pehrr** = **krrpe**    | _when_  |
| **pefya** = **fyape**    | _how_   |

Question words, like these here, are listed in the dictionary as _inter._ (which stands for _interrogative_)

Notice that when you use -**pe**+ on the end of the word, the letter changing bit is avoided. This is handy for people who often forget to change the first letter.

Using these words is simple, and a lot like English. The only difference is that the word doesn't have a set place in the sentence because Na'vi word order is flexible. So here are some examples of using some of these words:

## Asking Questions Using -pe+

### Examples

> **Nga tupe lu?**<br>
> _Who are you?_<br>
> <br>
> **Nga za'u ftu peseng?**<br>
> _Where do you come from? / Where are you from?_<br>

Question words (such as those listed in the previous table) do not need to come first or last or anywhere specific -- note the first example where **tupe** comes in the middle unlike in the English translation where _Who_ has to come first. (More on words like **ftu** later.)

It is also possible to stick -**pe**+ onto any noun.

### Examples

> **Ngaru sunu peioang?**<br>
> _Which animal do you like?_<br>
> <br>
> **Tsamsiyupe lu lom?**<br>
> _Which warrior is missing?_<br>

## Answering -pe+ Questions

Answering -**pe**+ questions works exactly how you might think it does. Here are some possible answers to all the above examples:

> **Oe Tirea Aean lu.**<br>
> _I am Tirea Aean._<br>
> <br>
> **Oe za'u ftu Yuesey.**<br>
> _I come from The USA._<br>

As you can see, one way to look at it is, -pe+ questions are seeking a noun as the answer. You can repeat the question asked, but replace the question word with the answer it seeks, as I've done above. This is not a requirement though; word order possibilities remain flexible as ever.

> **ikran sunu oer.**<br>
> _I like banshee._<br>
> <br>
> **Lom lu Tsu'tey**<br>
> _Tsu'tey is missing._<br>

Here, I chose to use whichever order instead of repeating the same word order as was asked in the question.

## Asking and Answering Yes/No Questions

All the above questions require a specific answer which is either the name of a person or place, or a time or a reason, etc. There is another very common type of question to ask: The yes/no question. This is super easy. All you do is add **srak** to the end of the sentence, or **srake** to the beginning.

### Examples

> **Ngaru lu fpom.**<br>
> _you have peace._<br>
> <br>
> **Ngaru lu fpom srak?**<br>
> _Do you have peace?_<br>
> <br>
> **Yom ngal teylut.**<br>
> _You eat beetle larvae._<br>
> <br>
> **Srake yom ngal teylut?**<br>
> _Do you eat beetle larva?_<br>

The answer to a **srake/srak** question is either **srane** (_yes_) or **kehe** (_no_). It's also possible, like in English, to explain the situation instead of answering **srane** or **kehe**, or after doing so.

Hopefully this has been simple and helpful.
