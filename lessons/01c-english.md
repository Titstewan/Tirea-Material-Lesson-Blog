# Greetings & Introductions

Hello, and welcome to the first of a new series of Na'vi Language lessons! If you haven't already, I highly recommend that you check out the audio clips on the [Sounds](http://localhost/material/?p=sounds) page to get a solid feel for how the language is pronounced. Here are some of the classic building blocks of getting started with conversation in Na'vi.

## Saying Hello

The Na'vi word for _hello_ is **kaltxì**.

Another popular greeting you may remember from the film is

- **Oel ngati kameie.**
- _I see you_

A breakdown:

- **oel** is a form of _I_.
- **ngati** is a form of _you_.
- **kameie** is a form of the verb _to See [in a deep spiritual sense]_.

You may be asking, "Doesn't that say, _'I you See'_?" And you'd be correct; it does say that. In the Na'vi language, the word order is much more flexible than that of English. More about that later. For now, we will keep it simple.

When you want to address someone directly by their name or title, the word **ma** must be used just before the name. For example:

- **Kaltxì ma Neytiri!**
- _Hello, Neytiri!_

And one from the film:

- **Ma sempul, oel ngati kameie.**
- _Father, I see you._

## How are you?

The Na'vi do not really ask, "_How are you?_", but rather something more like "_Do you have peace/well-being?_" Here's how it works:

- **Ngaru lu fpom srak?**
- _Do you have peace/well-being?_
- Literally: "To you is peace/well-being (yes/no)?"

A breakdown:

- **ngaru** is another form of _you_ that means _to you_.
- **lu** is the verb _am/are/is/be_.
- **fpom** is _peace/well-being_.
- **srak** is a word that changes a statement into a yes/no question. It goes at the end of the sentence, or at the very beginning as **srake**

## I'm well / not well / so-so

Since _How are you_ in Na'vi is actually a yes/no question, its answers include the following:

- **Srane.** _Yes._
- **Kehe.** _No._
- **Tam ke tam.** A phrase that basically means _meh_ or _so-so_.

To ask the question back to whoever asked you first, you have two options:

- **ngaru lu fpom srak?**
- _Do you have well-being?_

or

- **ngaru tut?**
- _How about you? / What about you?_

## My name is / I am

Although in Na'vi you _could_ say literally,

- **Oeyä tstxo lu ____.**
- _My name is ____._

It's much more Na'vi-like to say it like this:

- **Oeru fko syaw ____.**
- _One calls me ____._
- Literally: "To me one calls ____."

Since the Na'vi language has flexible word order, if the above sentence gives you any trouble, you can change the word order. Perhaps to something like this:

- **Oeru syaw fko ____.**
- or
- **Fko oeru syaw ____.**

## What's your name?

This question is very similar to its reply, which is found in the previous section. _What's your name?_ in Na'vi is more like _How are you called?_ and is typically worded like this:

- **Fyape fko syaw ngar?**
- _How are you called?_
- Literally: "How one calls to you?"

or:

- **Pefya syaw fko ngaru?**
- _How are you called?_
- Literally: "How calls one to you?"

Note that **Fyape/Pefya** are two forms of the same word, and **ngar/ngaru** are also two forms of the same word.

- _Nice to meet you_ in Na'vi translates to **Smon nìprrte'.**
- Literally: "[you are] familiar [to me] pleasurably"

## Goodbye

Here are some popular Na'vi goodbyes:

- **Kiyevame / Kìyevame**
- _See you again soon_

Either version is fine; Some use the version with i because it's easier, some use the version with ì because it looks cooler.

- **Eywa ngahu**
- _May Eywa be with you_
- Literally: Eywa you-with

And another one you may often see:

- **Hayalovay**
- _Until next time_
