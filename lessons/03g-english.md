# Have, Plurals, Changes

**Kaltxì**! And welcome to Lesson 3.

This time, we talk about having something, and how to talk about more than one thing.

## To Have

First, let's talk about having something. You have most likely noticed that a verb to have does not exist in Na'vi. Different languages have different ways of saying things.

In English, we say stuff like this:

- _I have a crossbow_
- _You have a bow_
- _She has a spear_

In Na'vi, we say those this way:

- **lu oeru tskalep**
- **ngaru lu tsko**
- **lu poru tukru**

Do you see the pattern? You actually say

- _A crossbow is to me_
- _A bow is to you_
- _A spear is to her_

Remember, Na'vi word order is flexible. I just randomly chose to write the second one differently.

## More Than One

In English, to say there is more than one of something, we usually add an s to the end. But sometimes there is an outlandish or just unpredictable way it has to be done. Either way, it must be memorized. You know how it is:

- hunter -> hunters
- enemy -> enemies
- fish -> fish

In Na'vi, it's a lot more predictable. In fact, it's totally predictable. There are three different things you put onto the beginning of a noun. They are:

- **me**+ (_two of whatever it is_)
- **pxe**+ (_three of whatever it is_)
- **ay**+ (_in general, just many of whatever it is_)

Now, when you use these, the original word might change its first letter/sound, depending on what it starts with. (this is why there is a + sign on them. to tell you that they cause this to happen). The letter/sound changes that occur are as follows:

Before | After
------ | -----
'      | (disappears altogether)
kx     | k
px     | p
tx     | t
k      | h
p      | f
t      | s
ts     | s

To easier remember these, think of it this way:

- **kx, px, tx** soften up and lose their **x**.
- **k, p, t** soften up and become related sounds (made in just about the same area of the mouth) **h, f, s**
- **'** just softens up by going away.

Here are some examples, to match the English ones above:

- **taronyu** --> **aysaronyu**
- **kxutu** --> **aykutu**
- **payoang** --> **ayfayoang**

### Some notes

When using **ay**+ on a word where the first letter changes, it's okay to just leave off ay after having changed the letter. For example:

- **Aysaronyu hahaw.** = **Saronyu hahaw.**
- _hunters sleep_

**me**+, **pxe**+, and **ay**+ aren't the only things that cause this first letter change thing to happen. More on that in a later lesson.
