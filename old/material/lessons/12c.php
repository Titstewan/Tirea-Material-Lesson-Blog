  <div class="titlename">Lesson Twelve: -ing in Na&#39;vi</div>
  <br><br>

	<!-- lesson content -->
	<p>
		<span class="navword">Kaltxì</span> nìmun! This time I wanna talk about the three different ways to say -ing in Na&#39;vi. <img src="img/smiley.gif"/>
	</p>
	<p>In English, we use the same -ing ending in at least three different ways. In Na&#39;vi, all three of those translate to three different ways instead of using the same one.</p>
	<p>
		<u>In English</u>, the three main uses for -ing are as in the following examples:
	</p>
	<ol class="lindent">
		<li>
			<em>
				She <span class="red-text">is</span> hunt<span class="red-text">ing</span> a hexapede
			</em>.
		</li>
		<li>
			<em>
				A hunt<span class="lime-text">ing</span> thanator is dangerous.
			</em>
		</li>
		<li>
			<em>
				Hunt<span class="blue-text">ing</span> is fun.
			</em>
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		<u>In Na&#39;vi</u>, these same three are:
	</p>
	<ol class="lindent">
		<li>
			<strong>
				Pol t<span class="red-text">er</span>aron yerikit.
			</strong>
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>
				T<span class="lime-text">us</span>aron<span class="yellow-text">a</span> palulukan lu lehrrap.
			</strong>
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>
				<span class="blue-text">Tì</span>t<span class="lime-text">us</span>aron lu &#39;o&#39;.
			</strong>
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		In 1, we use the position 1 infix <span class="red-text">er</span> to show that "hunt" is an ongoing action, "hunting". Note that <span class="red-text">er</span> already has the meaning of "<span class="red-text">am/is/are</span> do<span class="red-text">ing</span>" built right in. So it&#39;s redundant and incorrect to say stuff like *Po lu teraron.<br  />
		<br  />
		In 2, the infix <span class="lime-text">us</span> is used. <span class="lime-text">us</span> is another position 1 infix, but instead of making a verb ongoing, it turns it into an adjective! T<span class="lime-text">us</span>aron<span class="yellow-text">a</span> palulukan, "a hunt<span class="lime-text">ing</span> thanator" -- "hunt<span class="lime-text">ing</span>" is an <em>adjective</em> describing the thanator, rather than saying "the thanator <span class="red-text">is</span> hunt<span class="red-text">ing</span>", which would use <span class="red-text">er</span>. Note that because the verb has been turned into an adjective, you must use -<span class="ygold">a</span>- with it. Also, <span class="lime-text">us</span> adjectives cannot be used with lu, as in *Po lu tusaron. You must say that as Po t<span class="red-text">er</span>aron, "he <span class="red-text">is</span> hunt<span class="red-text">ing</span>."<br  />
		<br  />
		In 3, we have taken the <span class="lime-text">us</span> form, and added the <span class="blue-text">tì</span>- prefix to make it into a noun. You can add <span class="blue-text">tì</span>- and <span class="lime-text">us</span> to any verb to make it mean "(<span class="blue-text">the activity</span> of) verb-ing". <span class="blue-text">Tì</span>t<span class="lime-text">us</span>aron lu &#39;o&#39;. (<span class="blue-text">the activity</span> of) hunting is fun.
	</p>
	<p>Hope this clears things up.</p>
