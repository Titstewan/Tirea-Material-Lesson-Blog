	<!-- lesson content -->
	<p>
		This blog post will hopefully better your understanding of the topical suffix -<span class="navword">ri</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		-<span class="navword">ri</span> introduces the topic of what you are about to say. It gives your sentence a theme, and this is often done in English by using "<em>As for...</em>" or simply "<em>for</em>".
	</p>
	<p>
		The -<span class="navword">ri</span> in "<span class="navword">ngeyä srungìri ngaru irayo si oe</span>" lets us know that the theme is the "<span class="navword">srung</span>" - the help. It tells us that the reason that <span class="navword">oe</span> is thanking to <span class="navword">nga</span> is the <span class="navword">srung</span>... in other words, <span class="navword">oe</span> thanks <span class="navword">nga</span> for their srung. "<em>I thank you for your help.</em>"<br />
			The topic (word with -<span class="navword">ri</span>) almost always comes first in the sentence.
	</p>
	<p>
		-<span class="navword">ri</span> is found most commonly in sentences with:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<span class="navword">irayo si</span> (for the "<em>thank for</em>" meaning)
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="navword">tsap&#39;alute si</span> (for the "<em>apologise for</em>" meaning)
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="navword">pey</span> (for the "<em>wait for</em>" meaning)
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="navword">kllfro&#39;</span> (for the "<em>be responsible for</em>" meaning)
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="navword">tìkangkem si</span> (for the "<em>work on</em>" meaning)
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Example sentences:</p>
	<ul class="nobullets">
		<li>
			<span class="navword">Syurari yerikä irayo si awnga por.</span> "<em>We thank the hexapede for his energy.</em>"
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="navword">Fìskxawngìri tsap&#39;alute sängi oe.</span> "<em>I apologise for this moron.</em>"
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="navword">Trrayìri ke tsun oe pivey!</span> "<em>I can&#39;t wait for tomorrow!</em>"
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="navword">Pori kllfro&#39; nga.</span> "<em>You are responsible for him.</em>"
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="navword">Tskori po tìkangkem si.</span> "<em>She works on the bow.</em>"
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Lastly, don&#39;t confuse -<span class="navword">ri</span> with <span class="navword">fpi</span>+. <span class="navword">Fpi</span> means "<em>for</em>" as in "<em>for the sake/benefit of</em>". With <span class="navword">fpi</span>, you are acting to benefit something. E.g. <span class="navword">Oe &#39;ìyem ngafpi</span>. "<em>I will cook for (the sake of) you.</em>"
